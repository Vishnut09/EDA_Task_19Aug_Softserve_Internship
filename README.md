Exploratory Data Analysis of Student Stress Levels
Objective of the Task
The main goal of this project is to explore and analyze the various factors that influence the stress levels of students. By examining a dataset that includes psychological, physiological, social, and academic factors, this analysis aims to identify the key contributors to student stress. This is achieved by conducting a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships and patterns within the data.

Dataset Source
The dataset used for this analysis is the "Student Stress Factors: A Comprehensive Analysis," which is publicly available on Kaggle. This dataset provides a wide range of variables that are crucial for understanding the multifaceted nature of student stress.

Student Stress Factors: A Comprehensive Analysis

Steps to Run
To replicate this analysis, you will need to have Python installed, along with several key libraries for data analysis and visualization. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook environment, which allows for a clear and organized presentation of the code and its outputs.

Prerequisites:

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

You will also need to install the following libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

Installation:

You can install the required libraries using pip with the following command:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Running the Analysis:

Download the StressLevelDataset.csv file from the Kaggle link provided above and place it in the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook.

Launch the Jupyter Notebook and open the .ipynb file.

Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to load the data, perform the analysis, and generate the visualizations.
